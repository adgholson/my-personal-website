        <h1>Software Engineer</h1>
        <p>I started my Software Engineering career online at Flatiron School!</p>

        <p>From a very young age, I've always been interested in computers. I thought they were the craziest most cool thing ever! And from a young age, I knew I wanted to pursue some sort 
          of job involving them. Luckly for me computers practically run the world, and almost every job you can think of requires some sort of tech work. After graduating High School, I attempted 
          attending college. Unfortunately during my second year, COVID-19 hit the world and I was forced to go home and quarantine. Since then college has been out of reach. Life caught up with me quickly
          and I had no way of setting time aside for 4 years of school. Enter Flatiron School! When I discovered that I could get a certificate for Software Engineering in about 3 months with under half the price of 
          University, I knew I had to jump the opportunity as fast as I could. So here I am, ready to take on one of the hardest challenges I've faced yet! And when I'm done, hopefully I'll be a Software Engineer!

        <h1>Content Creator</h1>
        <p>I'm the creator of an entertainment brand called LegendDairy Productions!</p>
        <img src="D:\Youtube Content\Channel Files\Final Images\LDLogoLong_Shadow.png" alt="LegendDairy Logo" width="600" height="130">
        <p>Last year I started a YouTube channel focused around my favorite childhood videogame. Since then I've grown my brand to TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter. 
          I'm attempting to grow a small, loyal, fan base for some plans I have in the future. I can't elaborate on these plans, but I can say they tie directly into my pursuit of a Software Engineering career.
